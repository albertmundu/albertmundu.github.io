I am an `Integrated MTech-PhD student` at the Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad (IIIT-A), specializing in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing at the [Computer Vision & Biometrics Lab (CVBL)](https://cvbl.iiita.ac.in/). My PhD research focuses on Image/Video Scene Understanding. I have a deep passion for programming and continuously explore the latest trends in Computer Vision and Deep Learning.

Currently, I am serving as an `Assistant Professor` at [Galgotias University](https://www.galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/), where I teach graduate courses in machine learning, advanced data structures, and algorithm design and analysis. I have been praised for my clarity, approachability, and effectiveness in conveying complex concepts.

I completed my `Bachelor of Technology` in Computer Science and Engineering from the [North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology (NERIST), Nirjuli](https://nerist.ac.in/). My academic journey has been marked by a commitment to advancing knowledge and contributing to cutting-edge research.

Formerly, I worked as a `Computer Vision Engineer Intern` at [Spyne AI](https://www.spyne.ai/), where I developed and deployed AI models for e-commerce object shadow generation. My technical skills in this role included utilizing VAE, GAN, and Diffusion technologies, as well as generating shadow datasets using Blender 2.0+.

Additionally, I have extensive research experience as a Research Scholar at IIIT-A. My expertise spans Python, PyTorch, Deep Learning, and various AI technologies, enabling me to deliver innovative solutions in the field of Computer Vision.

I am driven by a passion for pushing the boundaries of AI and computer vision and am committed to leveraging my skills and knowledge to contribute to pioneering projects.
