## Design and Analysis of Algorithms

This course covers fundamental techniques for designing efficient algorithms and analyzing their complexity. Topics include:

- Asymptotic analysis and Big-O notation
- Divide and conquer strategies
- Greedy algorithms
- Dynamic programming
- Graph algorithms
- NP-completeness

**Target Audience:** BTech undergraduate students  
**Prerequisites:** Data Structures

Materials and resources will be provided during lectures and on the course portal.
